## Planning Story

The planning began with wireframes to undersand the basic layout of the application. Then the project was broken down into different parts that could be broken down into steps. Originally I started with the Javascript functionality when I should have started with user authentication. Starting with authentication helpes maintain code organization and would have prevented me from having to rewrite some functionality later on in the process.
This is a simple game application, the user can log in and play tic tac toe!
